 <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <img src="Voyi.png" alt="Voyi" class="logo-img">

<p>
Gentleman Wear was founded by Sibonelo Voyi, a visionary chemical engineer, astrophysics trainee, and bold entrepreneur with a passion for merging science, ambition, and timeless style. Born in KwaZulu-Natal and forged through years of academic and professional excellence, Sibonelo is more than just the mind behind the brand — he is the living embodiment of its message: refined strength, purpose, and greatness.
</p>

<p>
Sibonelo holds a BSc (Honours) in Chemical Engineering from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and has built his expertise across multiple high-performance industries. His journey spans roles in precision manufacturing, water treatment, cement process control, and space science. Whether working with SCADA systems in cement plants or analyzing astrophysical data using Python and CASA, Sibonelo consistently applies discipline and innovation to every challenge.
</p>

<p>
As a former trainee in the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA) programme, he gained insight into both radio and optical astronomy — an experience that expanded his vision of possibility and prepared him for future roles at the intersection of engineering and space technology. He is also a published researcher, with work on valuable metal recovery techniques presented at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and shared via ResearchGate.
</p>

<p>
His leadership extends beyond technical fields. As a Legacy Ambassador for the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and a student member of the African Astronomical Society (AfAS), Sibonelo has inspired young minds across Africa through science outreach, mentoring, and community engagement.
</p>

<p>
Gentleman Wear was born out of this remarkable journey — a brand built to reflect the power, poise, and purpose of men who are not just aiming high, but determined to look the part while doing it. Sibonelo believes that fashion is a declaration: it speaks before you do. It reflects character, discipline, and the pursuit of greatness.
</p>

<p>
Each piece from Gentleman Wear carries his message: dress with purpose, lead with integrity, and always assemble the great within.
